    A markdown-formatted list of all identified food items in the format: 
    - <name>: <weight in grams> â€” confidence: <confidence level>%
    Only include results where confidence is 90% or higher.

    and compare them with the current inventory. For each recipe, list only the
    missing ingredients along with the quantity to be acquired.
  expected_output: >
    A markdown-formatted summary with:
    - The names and URLs of the top 3 recipes
