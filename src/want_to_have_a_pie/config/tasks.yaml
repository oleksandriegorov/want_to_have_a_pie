    If confidence in any item's identification or quantity is below 90%, repeat the analysis.
    If there is a food product - list it, do not try to find out/guess its ingredients.

    - <name>: <weight in grams> â€” confidence: <confidence level>%
    Only include results where confidence is 90% or higher.
